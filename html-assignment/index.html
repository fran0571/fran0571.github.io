      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hello there! My name is <strong>Johely Franco</strong>, I am a Venezuelan living in Canada. Currently full-time student at Algonquin College and part time worker. Since 2021, Canada has become in my new home and Ottawa my town. In pursuit of leverage my skills, I decided to enrol in  <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program this year because I am passionate about <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> and Human-Centred design. So far, I have been enjoying my classes surrounded with resourceful classmates and instructors.

        One of my goals is to learn about <em>web development</em> and this page is my starting point. <strong>My 1<sup>st</sup> web page ever!</strong>. Additionally, I want to understand all the aspects involved in designing an efficient web site and I have found that subjects such as <em>design foundation, graphic design, and photography</em> aid to enhance this purpose. Finally, thanks for taking the time to read this brief introduction.
